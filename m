Hi Mathieu,

> I got a bug report on ARM which appears to be caused by an aggressive gcc optimisation starting from gcc 4.8.x due to lack of constraints on the current_thread_info() inline assembly. The only logical explanation for his issue I see so far is that read of the preempt_count within might_sleep() is reordered with preempt_enable() or preempt_disable(). AFAIU, this kind of issue also applies to other architectures.

This sounds almost identical to an issue I experienced with our optimised
per-cpu code (more below).

Yup, that sucks, because you end up unable to cache the value when you know
it hasn't changed.

The way I got around this for the per-cpu code is to include a dummy memory
constraint for the stack. This has a couple of advantages:

	(1) It hazards against a "memory" clobber, so doesn't require use of
	    `volatile'

	(2) It doesn't require GCC to emit any address generation code,
	    since dereferencing the sp is valid in ARM assembly

so adding something like:

	asm("" :: "Q" (*sp));

immediately after the declaration of sp in current_therad_info might do the
trick. Do you have a way to test that?

Cheers,

Will
