We should probably add non-signed modules to the exception list of
tainted modules considered by tracepoints.

Oh, wow. So a non-signed module can simply add a trusted signature, just
like that ? This seems like a nice hack indeed!

Indeed, it looks like we should make tracepoint.c more specific wrt what
modules it rejects. Rejecting tracepoints from non-signed modules seems
more strict than what should be required, but this would require that we
introduce a new TAINT_UNTRUSTED flag to distinguish between a non-signed
module and a module which has been forcefully loaded.

Thoughts ?

Thanks,

Mathieu
