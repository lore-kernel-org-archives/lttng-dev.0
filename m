No worries. As soon as I've been able to reproduce it on my test box
(with serial port), the NMI watchdog had a pretty reasonable explanation
for the issue.

I just tried your patch, and it indeed seems to fix the lockup I've been
experiencing with lttng-modules. Do you plan pushing this fix into
master, and submitting it for inclusion into stable 3.10 and stable 3.11 ?
I'm planning on dealing with with this issue with a blacklist of
kernel versions that will prevent people from building lttng-modules
against broken kernels as soon as the patch makes it into those trees.

I will reply to the rest of your email separately, so this thread can
focus on getting the fix upstream quickly.

Thanks!

Mathieu
