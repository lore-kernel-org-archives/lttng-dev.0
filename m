I agree with you on this.

I now notice that all the tracepoints within kernel headers have been removed,
this is why we're talking past each other. As soon as there is a tracepoint
within a static inline function in a header shared between modules, you end up
having instances of tracepoint call sites with the same names within different
modules.

So I understand that you wish to banish tracepoints from static inline
functions within headers to ensure they only appear within a single module.
This seems to be a step backward, but let's assume we stick to that rule.
Then how do you envision dealing with Link-Time Optimisations (LTO) ?

Yep, agreed.

There are no duplicate tracepoint that I'm aware of in the kernel (or
very few, and they are in similar functions in the same module).

This only leaves tracepoints in header files and the impact of LTO as
requirements for having tracepoint callsites with the same name across
modules.

Thoughts ?
