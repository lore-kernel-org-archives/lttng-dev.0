Ah, OK, schedule_on_each_cpu() could certainly do that - it has to wait
for every CPU to context switch and schedule the worker function.

There's a lot we could do here.  Such as not doing the schedule_work()
at all for a cpu which has an empty lru_add_pvec.  Or even pass down
the address_space and only schedule the work for CPUs which have a page
from *this mapping* in their lru_add_pvec.  That will all be highly
racy, but as long as the failure mode is "flushed unnecessarily" then
that's OK.
