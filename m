Do you mean that the tracepoint probe will be unregistered from within
tracepoint.c whenever all modules containing tracepoint call sites are
unloaded ? If so, how do you plan to handle ownership of the "name",
"probe" and "data" pointer ? They belong to the tracer. Would they simply
leak ?

I don't mind the extra work on the LTTng side at all. What I am concerned
about are changes that would make the tracepoint API sloppy.

I don't care about doing extra work in LTTng, no worries about that.
I'm just trying to ensure all the corner cases are thought through
when a change such as this is proposed in a core infrastructure like
tracepoints.
