I think you are doing it wrong. This is a poster child case for
using Direct IO and completely avoiding the page cache altogether....

Yup, you're emulating direct IO semantics with buffered IO.

This seems to be an emerging trend I'm seeing a lot of over the past
few months - I'm hearing about it because of all the wierd corner
case behaviours it causes because sync_file_range() doesn't provide
data integrity guarantees and fadvise(DONTNEED) can randomly issue
lots of IO, block for long periods of time, silently do nothing,
remove pages from the page cache and/or some or all of the above.

Direct IO is a model of sanity compared to that mess....

Cheers,

Dave.
