liburcu is a LGPLv2.1 userspace RCU (read-copy-update) library. This
data synchronization library provides read-side access which scales
linearly with the number of cores. It does so by allowing multiples
copies of a given data structure to live at the same time, and by
monitoring the data structure accesses to detect grace periods after
which memory reclamation is possible.

liburcu-cds provides efficient data structures based on RCU and
lock-free algorithms. Those structures include hash tables, queues,
stacks, and doubly-linked lists.

We are going forward with a stable-0.6 branch to push important fixes to
the old 0.6.x series. Please note that the current 0.7.x branch has a
different fix for this issue, which will be released shortly into 0.7.5.

Please note that the bug below occurs very rarely, only when invoking
call_rcu_data_free() for per-cpu or per-thread callback-invokation
threads (typically before application exit).

Changelog:
2012-09-11 Userspace RCU 0.6.8
        * Fix: call_rcu list corruption on teardown
