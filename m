I did not view the path as being performance critical and did not anticipate
a delay that severe. The original test case as well was based on
sequential IO as part of a backup so I was also generally expecting the
range to be populated. I looked at the other users of lru_add_drain_all()
but there are fairly few. compaction uses them but only when used via sysfs
or proc. ksm uses it but it's not likely to be that noticable. mlock uses
it but it's unlikely it is being called frequently so I'm not going to
worry performance of lru_add_drain_all() in general. I'll look closer at
properly detecting when it's necessarily to call in the fadvise case.
