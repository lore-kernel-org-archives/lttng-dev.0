Right now the current change actually fixes a bug. It tells the tracing
utility that the tracepoint that was to be enabled was or wasn't.

And they shouldn't be tracing their modules. That should be up to the
corporate system administrators.

This is all out of scope with the latest proposal, so I will ignore it.

Honestly, LTTng has been rejected because the maintainer of it tends to
sacrifice everything else to make tracing better.

A distro could set something like this up, with todays tools. If
grandma needed to start tracing, it was already too late for her to get
a report.

You read too much into what I say. Like the "No signed-off-by". I was
actually telling you that tracepoints should not be enabled by non root
unless there was a daemon to control it. We both got off an tangents.

ssh code is a small set of code compared to the thousands of random usb
drivers, including several that are in staging, that still happen to be
turned on by distros.

We're working on that.

Yes, but it still lies to the internal user in this case. Which is
wrong.

To me that's a work around, not a real fix.

Yep, see my responses.

I have a good idea of what needs to be done. I just need you to look at
things with a different perspective than what you are use to.
