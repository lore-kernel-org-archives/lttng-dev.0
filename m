The above is not inline assembly, it is a local register variable extension,
see

Sure.

As it is not inline asm extension, you can't.
Of course you could add asm volatile ("" : "=r" (ret) : "0" (sp));
or similar and thus make it a barrier, but I think the current
definition of current_thread_info meant to avoid all that extra
overhead.  Why does it matter when sp is different between the
current_thread_info () calls?  As long as sp & ~(THREAD_SIZE - 1) is
the same, it shouldn't make a difference.  Or is the call in between those
changing sp to something else?
