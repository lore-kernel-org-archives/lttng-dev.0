Hi Paul,

I recognise that this is an issue in the Linux kernel, since a simple
store is used and expected to be performed atomically when aligned.
However, I think this does not affect liburcu, see below:

Here, the macro "_CMM_STORE_SHARED(x, v)" is doing the actual store.
It stores v into "x". So adding a CMM_ACCESS_ONCE(_v), as you propose
here, is really only making sure the return value (usually unused),
located on the stack, is accessed with a volatile access, which does not
make much sense.

What really matters is the _CMM_STORE_SHARED() macro:

#define _CMM_STORE_SHARED(x, v) ({ CMM_ACCESS_ONCE(x) = (v); })

which already uses a volatile access for the store. So this seems to be
a case where our preemptive use of volatile for stores in addition to
loads made us bug-free for a gcc behavior unexpected at the time we
implemented this macro. Just a touch of paranoia seems to be a good
thing sometimes. ;-)

Thoughts ?

Thanks,

Mathieu
