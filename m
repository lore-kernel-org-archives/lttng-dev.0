In general, I see no reason why the compiler should be forced to
preserve a register between blocks like that.  Relying on a value
magically appearing in a general-purpose register seems to me fragile at
best.  Code like this adds inter-block dependencies that would not
normally be there, and I'd rather not gamble on how the various
optimisation passes deal with it, if it is even noticed at all.

What happens if you some code clobbering eax (e.g. a function call)
between those two blocks?  What do you think should happen?
