We can make the registered tracepoint up the mod count to prevent it
from unloading. But that probably defeats the purpose.

Tracepoints should all be disabled when the module is unloaded. If you
have a tracepoint callback still being called when the module is
unloaded then something is seriously wrong. That means the callback
will go back to the trace_foo() call which is in the module code and
will no longer exist. Kernel panic is the result.

I'm a bit confused at what you are doing. As this is totally unrelated
to anything that happens in the kernel.

Well, actually that's exactly what the trace_event code does. It
disables any event of the module that happens to be enabled.

Look at event_remove() in kernel/trace/trace_events.c

On module unload, the events are destroyed.

Thus, what your module should do, is exactly what event_remove() does.
On module unload, you unregister any of the tracepoints that were
registered. Just like any other module resource. If you request a
resource on the behalf of a module, it is up to you to free it when the
module is unloaded.

The tracepoint code will just destroy what it set up when the module
was loaded. It's up to your module to clean up the allocations that you
made when the module was loaded on unload. Just like we do for all
other resources.

Mathieu, stop thinking that tracepoints are special. They are not.
