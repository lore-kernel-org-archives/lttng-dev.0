Thanks for putting my e-mail in the right thread Alexander.

I also wanted to point out that we recently were hit by the following bug:

http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58854

which can mess up the handling of SP and cause strange failures in the kernel.

From the description of the bug in this thread, we don't think the
bugs are related but whoever is going to try removing the "const
attribute" please also make sure that the bug still reproduces after
applying the fix for the GCC bug above.

Luis
