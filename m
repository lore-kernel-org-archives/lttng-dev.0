Since O_DIRECT does not seem to provide acceptable throughput, it may be
interesting to investigate other ways to lessen the latency impact of
the fadvise DONTNEED hint.

Given it is just a hint, we should be allowed to perform page
deactivation lazily. Is there any fundamental reason to wait for worker
threads on each CPU to complete their lru drain before returning from
fadvise() to user-space ?

Thanks,
