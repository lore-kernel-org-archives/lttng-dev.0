I'm talking about all users of tracepoints, all in tree and out of tree
users. We need the design and API for tracepoint to stay sound, and for that
we need to study carefully the impact of the changes you propose on module
load/unload scenarios.

In a corporate environment, it's pretty much never the end user who ends
up being the system administrator of his machine.

Tracing the kernel should require root privilege for the process interacting
with the kernel ABI, I agree with that part. However, the end user of the
machine should not need to be in a root shell to interact with tracing. For
instance, if the tracer only provides summarized information pinpointing
issues, the system administrator could very well allow the end user to use
tracing without being root.

An example of this is the way laptops nowadays handle wifi connexions through
a root daemon setting up the network (interfacing with kernel ABI), but which
gets the user interaction though a user interface running in user context.

And the reason for that is because the said kernel community has been deaf to
the requirements of the user-base we target. Unlike Ftrace, we are not targeting
kernel developers, and unlike perf, we are not targeting sampling use-cases. Yes,
there is a partial infrastructure overlap, but LTTng has been rejected on the
ground of "fear of work duplication" which, frankly, makes no sense, since we are
targeting different use cases. Some of the infrastructure work needs to be done
in common, and some of the work needs to go in different directions.

I think the tension that exists in the Linux tracing community is not helping
progress at all in this area. This is why I'm trying to re-open the dialogue.

Is it that way because the current tracing tools are so unusable by
non kernel-developers that those are the only ones able to interact with
those tools ?

You seem to mix "knowledge needed to make sense of a trace" with "knowledge
needed to gather a trace". The first kind of knowledge can be put into
analysis tools, but they cannot be used widely if gathering a trace requires
people to be kernel experts too.

>

Perhaps because her kernel crashes and she hates to lose the emails she is
writing to her grandchildren when the crash happens, and because there is a
nice tool that allow her to click "yes, I want to report issues to my
favorite Linux distribution", which will then analyze the trace report and
come up with an automated kernel upgrade a few weeks later.

This was the logical consequence of your recommendation of having a root proxy
daemon to handle this.

Yes, no code is perfect, and that includes USB drivers. But in that line of
reasoning, why bother about security at all ? Since the ssh server code is
imperfect, you might as well publish your private key. Sorry, this line of
reasoning makes no sense.

I'm OK with that, as long as the tracepoint infrastructure itself is consistent.

The root of the original problem here was that tracepoint.c was skipping
non-signed modules without printing any error. We added an printk error
message for this.

See other leg of this thread for the "high signal/noise" ratio technical

No, currently tracepoint offers no API to query the state of tracepoint callsites
other than the seqfile iterator (which I proposed to removed in a RFC patch
yesterday).

I appreciate the compromise efforts you have made, but my points here are about
sound design/API, and I have technical concerns still unanswered (see other leg
of the thread). This is not about what LTTng needs, but about keeping the
tracepoint API consistent.

I don't mind doing the heavy lifting in LTTng at all. My concern here
is (again) about keeping the tracepoint API semantically consistent when
module load/unload occur. A lot of thinking went into this when I initially
created tracepoint.c, and I don't want it to be degraded by a change that is
not thought thoroughly.

Thanks,

Mathieu
