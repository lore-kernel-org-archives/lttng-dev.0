Need to re-do them the way they asked. Could take some time. However I
wanted first to make sure it make sense to continue that approach.

Let me try it, maybe I can migrate my effort into one code basis.

python looked nice because I saw libraries / interfaces on both sides.

yes.

Yes. The CTF writer is stupid and takes all arguments as-is and passes
it over the babeltrace part of CTF writer. This works well for the
ftrace events (handled by trace_unhandled()).


> I wonder we could add separated python callback for that

This (the to pickle part) tries come up with the common basis for the
CPU events. Therefore it renames the first few arguments (like s to
common_s) to make it consistent with the ftrace events.
The dso and symbol members look optional depending whether or not this
data was available at trace time. I *think* those may change within a
stream say if one library has debug symbols available and the other
does not. So I have no idea how you plan specific callbacks for those.
