I saw those 2 already in Arnaldo's tree

and there's some other replacement for this one comming in soon IIUC

any idea when this one will land in babeltrace git tree?

I made similar effort in C:

I made some *VERY* early perf convert example, mostly to try the ctf-writer
interface.. you can check in here:
  https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/jolsa/perf.git/log/?h=perf/ctf_2

It's able to convert single event (HW type) perf.data file into CTF data,
by adding just one integer field "period" and single stream, like:

  [jolsa@krava perf]$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/libbabeltrace/lib/ ./perf data convert --to-ctf=./ctf-data
  ...
  [jolsa@krava babeltrace]$ /opt/libbabeltrace/bin/babeltrace /home/jolsa/kernel.org/linux-perf/tools/perf/ctf-data
  [08:14:45.814456098] (+?.?????????) cycles: { }, { period = 1 }
  [08:14:45.814459237] (+0.000003139) cycles: { }, { period = 1 }
  [08:14:45.814460684] (+0.000001447) cycles: { }, { period = 9 }
  [08:14:45.814462073] (+0.000001389) cycles: { }, { period = 182 }
  [08:14:45.814463491] (+0.000001418) cycles: { }, { period = 4263 }
  [08:14:45.814465874] (+0.000002383) cycles: { }, { period = 97878 }
  [08:14:45.814506385] (+0.000040511) cycles: { }, { period = 1365965 }
  [08:14:45.815056528] (+0.000550143) cycles: { }, { period = 2250012 }
---

the goals for me is to have a convert tool, like in above example
perf data command and support in perf record/report to directl
write/read ctf data

Using python for this seems nice.. I'm not experienced python coder,
so just small comments/questions

this first iteration could be handled in the to-pickle step,
which could gather events description and store/pickle it
before the trace data

I understand this is just a early stage, but we want here
detection of the all event arguments, right?

I wonder we could add separated python callback for that
