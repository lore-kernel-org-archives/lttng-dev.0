Right there, this is not possible for a few reasons, namely:

- loop unrolling performed by the compiler can duplicate a tracepoint,
  even if it is only there once in the source code,
- inlining performed by the compiler may do the same,
- LTO, whenever it will start being used for the kernel, may do the same,
  and also spread call sites across modules.

There can be no 1 to 1 mapping between a probe function and a callsite
due to those compilers optimisations, even if we enforce the strictest
coding style rules possible on their use.

Thanks,

Mathieu
