Hrm, I seem to have mixed up the concerns regarding compiler
optimisations between the static keys with those related to tracepoints
(including that their predecessors "kernel markers" worked more like
static keys than tracepoint). I did work in both area pretty much at the
same time back in 2007-2008.

Having gotten my head back up straight, I now see the point in your
proposal. Thanks for bearing with me.

Even if we ever want to have tracepoints within header files, as long
as we have the DECLARE_TRACE() within the header, and a DEFINE_TRACE()
in one location in the loaded kernel image (or a loaded module we depend
on), it should be possible too. All tracepoint.c cares about is the site
defined by DEFINE_TRACE().

Allright. Have a good trip!

Thanks,
