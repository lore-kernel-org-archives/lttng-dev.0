Which I should have, schedule_on_each_cpu is documented to be slow.

This compile-only tested prototype should detect remaining pages in the rage
that were not invalidated. This will at least detect unpopulated pages but
whether it has any impact depends on what lttng is invalidating. If it's
invalidating a range of per-cpu traces then I doubt this will work because
there will always be remaining pages. Similarly I wonder if passing down
the mapping will really help if a large number of cpus are tracing as we
end up scheduling work on every CPU regardless.
