And the distribution just magically installs itself onto a computer? No,
a user does, and in doing so, they set up udev. A person installing a
distribution is a sysadmin. Even if it's grandma installing it herself.
She owns the box, no one else is doing anything for her (unless it's
your grandma).

Tracing is a root privilege.

This seems very specific to a single tracing tool that happens not to
be in the kernel tree.

I don't know why you are complaining. Think of this as your job
security.

No, but the majority of tracing users *are* kernel developers, or those
that are experts in the system.

Why would grandma want to trace the kernel?

I actually never said that. I said that you could have a proxy to
enable or disable the tracepoint. I don't know where you're getting
this crap from. Yes, I have suggested in the past that the ideal
approach is to have modprobe handle it, just like it handles other
module changes for one time deals. And yes, tracing a module is a one
time deal. But you seem to be getting in a tizzy thinking that's what I
recommended yesterday.

I wouldn't want people to have access to any box I own to be able to
just stick any usb device into the computer. Look at all the USB drivers
we have. You think they are all perfect. I'm sure it wouldn't be too
hard to find a bad USB device driver and make your own dongle to stick
in, that can root the box.

Have your LTTNg module dictate that policy.

Hmm, currently the probe lies to the user when the tracepoint doesn't
exist. We enable it and nothing happens. This BROKE IN TREE USERS!!!!

I suggest that we remove the probe when the module is unloaded. No
lying. Either a tracepoint exists when you enable it, or it doesn't.

But isn't that what we do today?

I didn't suggest this in this thread. I only pointed out that is the
most sane situation. But I've been trying to work with you, and you
don't seem to see that.

No, I don't want to know if this call site exists or not. This stupid
"tracepoint_probe_register()" that activates a tracepoint by name. But
if that tracepoint doesn't exist, it just returns normally as if
everything is fine and dandy. WTF!

Look Mathieu, I've been trying to be nice here. This crap has broken
in tree kernel users, and this magical "enable a non-existent
tracepoint, so when one is created, it will be enabled" is only used by
LTTng! NOBODY ELSE USES IT. This means that I can strip this usage out
of the kernel, as there are no uses of it in the kernel.

What you don't seem to realize, is that your methods broke the stuff
that is in the kernel, and you don't seem to give a shit about that.

The solution I like the most that I believe will work for both of us,
is to to move this magic "enable tracepoint in the future" to your
LTTng module. Have your module register a module load and unload handler
to be able to see the tracepoints that exist in the module, and you can
enable them then. When a module is unloaded, your module can do the
accounting to record that, and the state of its tracepoints. 

Looks like we can have it both ways. A way that works well for the
kernel, and a way that works well for you. But your module will need to
do the heavy work for what you want.

To me, a tracepoint should only be enabled when it exists. If it is
enabled in module when the module is unloaded, then it should be
removed after the module has left. If the module is loaded again, it is
up to the user (or your module) to enable that tracepoint again.
