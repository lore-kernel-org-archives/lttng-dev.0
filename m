For those just added in CC, https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/3/11/431 provides the
missing context. The discussion is about adding module load parameters as ABI
for end users to enable tracepoints in modules (Steven has proposed the idea
a couple of times in the past, I am against for the reasons I am exposing
below). This discussion will likely have deep impact on other changes Steven
is proposing for tracepoint.c (such as making tracepoint_probe_register()
return -ENODEV when no tracepoint call site is currently loaded for a given
tracepoint), so I think the audience should be broadened.

Uh ? There are tons of distributions that setup udevd for their users, and
no sysadmin has to interact with it.

If you use a box owned by your company, running Linux, but enforcing module
signature, you might be physically allowed to connect USB devices, and let
udevd load the appropriate modules for the connected devices, but that does
not mean you have root access at all. But having the ability to trace the
said computer from a user having "tracing" privileges is very valuable to
help debugging that machine.

Even without going that far, if you want tracing to be widely usable to
pinpoint issues within Linux and/or its applications or libraries, you
basically have to remove most user interactions from the picture, and let
automated tools gather tracing data to perform analysis. As soon as you
require users to fiddle with udev configuration, or pass special parameters
to modprobe, or if you start coupling the tracing infrastructure with the
module configuration, you just made tracing unusable for a vast majority of
Linux distribution users out there.

I've been trying to make my point that tracing should be first of all
_usable_ by non-expert Linux end users, but it seems that I'm completely
failing at getting the message through somehow. And believe me I've spent
years trying to voice this message. Perhaps I'm not cursing enough, perhaps
I'm not yelling enough. Rather than arguing, the path I'm currently taking
is to prove my point by putting the tools needed by my user community in
their hands.

If to you the majority of Linux users means "kernel developers", then
I can see how our point of views cannot be reconciled easily. From my
point of view, there are far more users who need those tracing tools that
are not kernel developers.

I never said the kernel should directly expose ABIs accessible by others
than root. Actually, this is the very reason we have a "lttng-sessiond"
daemon running as root to control kernel tracing. However, it can be
controlled by a "lttng" command line tool over unix sockets if the user
is part of the "tracing" group. Right there, this is the concept of your
proxy daemon. However, you seem to imply that this proxy daemon should
somehow fiddle with udevd and/or modprobe configuration to add temporary
system-wide parameters to how modules are loaded, depending on tracing
needs. Trying to couple something usually configured initially for a
large portion of a system's life (and even with tripwire validation that
/etc does not change over time) with something as transient as tracing
simply cannot work without causing havoc in the system configuration. So
no, having a tracing proxy daemon changing configuration of module
arguments cannot fly.

So if I understand your line of thought, you imply that anyone who can
plug a USB stick of any kind (memory stick, USB wifi card, etc) into a
computer should automatically have root access ? Is it just me, or it
makes no sense ?

What you're missing here is that the same tracepoint can appear within
more than one module.

I think there is a core, fundamental difference between the ways we see
tracing. You seem to see tracing as being solely part of the modules
that contain the caller tracing code. From my perspective, tracing fits
much better in the "aspect oriented programming" paradigm, since it spreads
the same "crosscutting concerns" across multiple modules. So yes, in AOP,
it makes perfect sense that tracing activation state goes beyond the
lifetime of a single loaded module: it spawns across core kernel, and zero,
one, or more loaded modules, independently of whether they are unloaded and
reloaded again.


So going back on the changes you proposed to the tracepoint infrastructure:

A) Making tracepoint_probe_register() unregister the probe and fail when
   there is no tracepoint call site present for a probe at that time:

With this approach, if the probe is registered when the module containing
the call site is loaded, and then that module is unloaded, it will leave
the probe in a registered state, leaving the tracer lying to the user,
letting them think there are currently callsites for this tracepoint when
there are none.

B) Making tracepoint_probe_register() just return an error (-ENOEDV), but
   leaving the probe registered.

I think we have already agreed that this compromise solution is a weird API
choice, since an error condition must be treated as a success by the caller.
Moreover, it has the same issue as (A) above: if the module is unloaded
after probe registration, the tracer is lying to the user, making them
think there is a call site loaded when there are none.

C) Adding module load arguments to specify which tracepoint should be
   enabled.

Please refer to my response above in this email to understand why I object.

Back to your original requirement: you want to let the tracer communicate
to end users whether a specific tracepoint has call sites or not. I'm
currently preparing a patch implementing a "tracepoint_callsite_count()"
API that will allow this, and it won't lie to the tracer like solutions
(A) and (B) above. Whenever the tracer queries the state, it will get the
current information about the number of enabled call sites, not some stale
data based on a prior registration error.

Thanks,

Mathieu
