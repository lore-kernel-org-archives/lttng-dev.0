There are cases where O_DIRECT falls back to buffered IO which is why you
might have found that page cache was still filling up. There are a few
reasons why this can happen but I would guess the common cause is that
the range of pages being written was in the page cache already and could
not be invalidated for some reason. I'm guessing this is the common case
for page cache filling even with O_DIRECT but would not bet money on it
as it's not a problem I investigated before.

Only to make sure they pages are actually dropped as requested. The reason
the wait was introduced in the first place was that page cache was filling
up even with the fadvise calls and causing disruption. In 3.11 disruption
due to this sort of parallel IO should be reduced but making fadvise work
properly is reasonable in itself. Was that patch I posted ever tested or
did I manage to miss it?
