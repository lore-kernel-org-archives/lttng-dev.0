We use POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED in LTTng so the kernel know it's not useful
to keep the trace data around after it is flushed to disk. From what I
gather from the commit changelog, it seems that the POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED
operation now touches kernel data structures shared amongst processors
that have much higher contention/overhead than previously.

How does your page cache memory usage behave prior/after this kernel
commit ?

Also, can you try instrumenting the "count", "start_index" and
"end_index" values within fadvise64_64 with commit
67d46b296a1ba1477c0df8ff3bc5e0167a0b0732 applied and log this though
LTTng ? This will tell us whether the lru_add_drain_all() hit is taken
for a good reason, or due to an unforeseen off-by-one type of issue in
the new test:

  if (count < (end_index - start_index + 1)) {

Thanks,

Mathieu
