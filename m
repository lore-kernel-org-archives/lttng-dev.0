Almost.  The only problem I can think of is that the other CPU flushes
its pagevec then a page gets freed then a memory hot-unplug occurs and
the memory hotplug handler frees and then unmaps the memory which was
used to hold the page's `struct page' (I don't think the current
mem-hotplug code even does this) and now this cpu's page->mapping
access goes oops.  

IOW, not worth worrying for a prototype "hey lets test this and see if
it fixes things" patch.
