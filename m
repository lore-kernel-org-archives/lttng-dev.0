That change wasn't terribly efficient - if there are any unpopulated
pages in the range (which is quite likely), fadvise() will now always
call invalidate_mapping_pages() a second time.

Perhaps this is fixable.  Say, make lru_add_drain_all() return a
success code, or even teach lru_add_drain_all() to return a code
indicating that one of the spilled pages was (or might have been) on a
particular mapping.


But I don't see why that would cause fadvise(POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED) to
sometimes take four milliseconds(!).  Is it possible that a context
switch is now occurring, so the fadvise()-calling task sometimes spends
a few milliseconds asleep?
