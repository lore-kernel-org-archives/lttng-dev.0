It seems more flexible to me to let this be handled by the tracer rather than
tracepoint.c.

This is only true for the tracepoint call sites located within this module.

I agree that the specific call sites within an unloaded module need to be
already quiescent by the time the module is unmapped from memory, no argument
there.

The scenario I'm painting here (ownership of name, probe and data through the
5 steps) is the common "enable tracing, disable tracing" scenario, where the
module is not necessarily unloaded.

The objects "name" and "data" can be dynamically allocated, and need to be
freed at some point. The probe provider module need to have its reference
count released after its probe function is unregistered. However, there
may still be tracepoint call sites in flights (again, this is a normal
enable tracing/disable tracing scenario, no module unload).

I detailed this scenario to answer your question "Are you telling me it's
not possible to delete the entire probe?", thus showing what the ownership
of objects passed to register/unregister is, to shed some light on why
it's currently not possible to unregister a tracepoint probe from
tracepoint.c, because it does not have ownership of those objects.

Isn't trace_event.c responsible for dealing with tracepoint probes rather
than call sites ? This is quite different. A tracepoint probe "foo" is only
located within a single module (the one you are unloading here). However,
if you try to unload a module that contains the callsite "foo", you have no
guarantee that no other modules also contain this callsite, and therefore
you cannot destroy the associated name, probe, nor data objects.

You seem to try to apply a logic that works in the case of the probes
defined by trace event to tracepoint call sites, but the fact is that
they are very different. Or again perhaps I'm just on the wrong track.

I'm trying to understand how module going of tracepoint probes and
call sites can be considered the same. What am I missing ?

Thanks,
