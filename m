As a clarification, I use 256kB "chunks" (sub-buffers) in my tests, not
1MB. Also, please note that since I'm using splice(), each individual
splice call is internally limited to 16 pages worth of data transfer
(64kB).

My test was performed on ext3 filesystem, that was itself sitting on
raid-1 software raid.
