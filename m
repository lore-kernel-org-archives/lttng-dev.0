This all brings to mind commit 509eb76ebf977 ("ARM: 7747/1: pcpu: ensure
__my_cpu_offset cannot be re-ordered across barrier()").

GCC seems overly happy with reordering asm() thingies.

Ideally we'd be able to tell gcc that:

  register unsigned long *sp asm ("sp")

not only acts like a variable but should be treated like a variable and
thus such reshuffeling should be limited to preserve program-order.

There doesn't seem to be any __attribute__() that can do this, and
currently out only recourse seems to add either volatile, which seems
overly strict as Mathieu said, or add fake input like Will did.
