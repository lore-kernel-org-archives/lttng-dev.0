Here is how LTTng consumerd is using POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED. Please let me
know if we are doing something stupid. ;-)

The LTTng consumerd deals with trace packets, which consists of a set of
pages. I'll just discuss how the pages are moved around, leaving out
discussion about synchronization between producer/consumer.

Whenever the Nth trace packet is ready to be written to disk:

1) splice the entire set of pages of trace packet N to disk through a
   pipe,
2) sync_file_range on trace packet N-1 with the following flags:
   SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_BEFORE | SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE | SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_AFTER
   so we wait (blocking) on the _previous_ trace packet to be completely
   written to disk.
3) posix_fadvise POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED on trace packet N-1.

There are a couple of comments in my consumerd code explaining why we do
this sequence of steps:

        /*
         * Give hints to the kernel about how we access the file:
         * POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED : we won't re-access data in a near future after
         * we write it.
         *
         * We need to call fadvise again after the file grows because the
         * kernel does not seem to apply fadvise to non-existing parts of the
         * file.
         *
         * Call fadvise _after_ having waited for the page writeback to
         * complete because the dirty page writeback semantic is not well
         * defined. So it can be expected to lead to lower throughput in
         * streaming.
         */

Currently, the lttng-consumerd is single-threaded, but we plan to
re-introduce multi-threading, and per-cpu affinity, in a near future.

Yannick will try your patch tomorrow and report whether it improves
performance or not,

Thanks!
