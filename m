Unfortunately I don't have a ARM cross-compiler setup ready. Nathan could test
it for us though.

It might shuffle things around enough to work around the issue, but with the
approach you propose, I would be concerned about the compiler being within
its rights to reorder the code into the following sequence:

struct thread_info *ptra, *ptrb;

ptra = current_thread_info();
/*
 * each current_thread_info() would have a clobber on *sp, which orders
 * those two wrt each other.
  */
ptrb = current_thread_info();

load from ptra->preempt_count;
/*
 * however, the following accesses that depend on ptra and ptrb could be
 * reordered if the compiler has no way to know that ptra and ptrb are
 * aliased.
 */
store to ptrb->preempt_count;

One question that might be worth asking: with the local register variable
extension (http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.8.2/gcc/Local-Reg-Vars.html#Local-Reg-Vars)
(thanks to Jakub for the pointer), should the compiler consider two variables
bound to the same register as being aliased or not ? AFAIU, local reg vars appear
to be architecture-specific, so maybe there is something fishy on ARM ?

Thanks,

Mathieu
